jQuery.ganttView
================

The jQuery.ganttView plugin is a plugin to create Gantt-like chart or
Leitstand with HTML. The plugin supports dragging and resizing the blocks
and callbacks to trap the updated data.

This version is based on https://github.com/thegrubbsian/jquery.ganttView.
I needed a more generic approach and had to remove or change lots of code so
contribution to the original project was not possible.

See Example for usage hints. Additional Documentation will hopefully follow
for the first stable version.

Please note that this is work in process so interface and name may change!
